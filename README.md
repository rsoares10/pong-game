## Installation

To play the game, you need to have Python and the Turtle library installed on your computer. You can download Python from the official website ([python.org](https://www.python.org/downloads/)) and install Turtle by running the following command in your terminal:

`pip install turtle`

Once you have Python and Turtle installed, you can run the game by executing the following command in your terminal:

`python main.py`

## AI Solution

The main goal of this project is to implement an AI solution that can play the game against itself. This involves creating an algorithm that can learn how to play the game and make decisions based on the position of the ball and paddles. We plan to use machine learning techniques such as reinforcement learning to train the AI agent.
